3. **From File Manager** - Double-click the `firefox_profile_manager.py` file

### Managing Profiles

1. **View Profiles** - The main window shows all your Firefox profiles with their names, paths, and creation dates
2. **Create New Profile** - Click "‚ûï Create Profile" and enter a name
3. **Launch Profile** - Select a profile and click "üöÄ Launch Profile" to start Firefox with that profile

## Uninstallation

To remove the Firefox Profile Manager:

```bash
rm ~/.local/bin/firefox-profiles
rm ~/.local/share/applications/firefox-profile-manager.desktop
update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications
```

## How It Works

The Firefox Profile Manager works by:

1. **Reading Firefox Configuration** - Parses `~/.mozilla/firefox/profiles.ini` to discover existing profiles
2. **Managing Profile Data** - Creates, modifies, and deletes profile directories and configuration entries
3. **Launching Firefox** - Uses the `firefox -P <profile-name>` command to start Firefox with specific profiles
4. **Desktop Integration** - Provides a desktop launcher for easy access from your applications menu

## File Locations

- **Firefox Profiles**: `~/.mozilla/firefox/`
- **Installed Script**: `~/.local/bin/firefox-profiles`
- **Desktop Launcher**: `~/.local/share/applications/firefox-profile-manager.desktop`

## Troubleshooting

### Firefox Not Found
If you get a "Firefox not found" error:
- Make sure Firefox is installed: `which firefox`
- Add Firefox to your PATH if it's installed in a non-standard location

### Permission Denied
If you get permission errors:
- Make sure the install script is executable: `chmod +x install-firefox-profile-manager.sh`
- Check that you have write permissions to `~/.local/bin` and `~/.local/share/applications`

### Desktop Launcher Not Appearing
If the application doesn't appear in your applications menu:
- Run: `update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications`
- Log out and log back in to refresh the desktop environment
- Check that your desktop environment supports `.desktop` files
